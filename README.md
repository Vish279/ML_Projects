# Machine Learning Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of three different machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks. Each model is trained on a specific dataset, and the results are plotted for visualization.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the datasets.
- `src/`: Contains the scripts for each model and plotting.
- `run.py`: Script to run all models and plot the results.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## How to Run

1. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the project:
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

## Datasets

- `logistic_regression_data.csv`: Dataset for Logistic Regression.
- `random_forest_data.csv`: Dataset for Random Forest.
- `neural_net_data.csv`: Dataset for Neural Network.

## Models

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Neural Network

## Plotting

The results include confusion matrices and classification reports for each model.
